- Vanilla js used.
- The code is highly optimized and stores the DOM elements and saves calls to document.getElementById.
- Pure css , vanilla js and HTML used.
- Common rendering code is made into a function to save code repetition.
- Common templates used for creating DOM elements by cloning template elements instead of repetitively calling document.createElement .
- Common code for making lists of DOM elements.
